Bundler:-
    - Webpack
    - Parcel
    - Vite

We are using parcel for igniting our app.

two types of dependencies are there:-
 - dev dependencies. when we are developing our app the dev dependencies are used.
 - normal dependencies..

 npm install -D parcel (here -D dev dependencies)

 "devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.9.3"
  }
    ^ automatically updates the minor version
    ~ it will automatically updates the major version
  caret and tilde in package.json version

  what is package.json     ???
  what is package.lock.json      ???

  package.json vs package.lock.json

transitive dependencies -> parcel have some dependencies and the dependencies have their own dependencies....
