Bundler:-
    - Webpack
    - Parcel
    - Vite

We are using parcel for igniting our app.

two types of dependencies are there:-
 - dev dependencies. when we are developing our app the dev dependencies are used.
 - normal dependencies..

 npm install -D parcel (here -D dev dependencies)

 "devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.9.3"
  }
    ^ automatically updates the minor version
    ~ it will automatically updates the major version
  caret and tilde in package.json version

  what is package.json     ???
  what is package.lock.json      ???

  package.json vs package.lock.json

  integrity in package.lock.json for checking the exact version of a particular package (dev == prod)

transitive dependencies -> parcel have some dependencies and the dependencies have their own dependencies....

what is npx ?
npx parcel index.html
npm means installing a package..
npx means executing a package.

ways to get react into our app...!
1. cdn
2. npm install react..

cdn links is not a preferred way..!

// React Element is an Object
// Learn about React.createElement in react....
// this can be a single child or and array of childrens... now in array it behaves like siblings...
// always put your app js file after importing the react cdn..
// cross origin
// what ever inside the root will be replaced by the render function..
